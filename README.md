# Swift Code Example

This repository contains a Swift code example demonstrating the use of protocols with associated types, generic structs, and protocol extensions.

## Description

In this code example, we define a protocol `Printable` with an associated type `DataType` and a method `printValue()`. We then implement the protocol with a generic struct `Printer<T>`, where `T` is the type of the value to be printed. Additionally, we extend the `Printable` protocol with a default implementation for the case where `DataType` is `Int`.
